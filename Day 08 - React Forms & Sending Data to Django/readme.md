## 📌 Goal:  
Learn how to create **forms in React** and send form data to a Django REST API.

## 📖 What You Will Learn:

## 🛠 Task:  
1️⃣ Create a React component called `TaskForm.js`.  
2️⃣ Use `useState` to store the form input (task title).  
3️⃣ Handle the form `onSubmit` event to send a **POST request** to the Django API.  
4️⃣ Update the `TaskList.js` component to **refresh** the list after submission.  
5️⃣ **Push your progress to GitHub**.  

## 🚀 Next Step:
